# Alias Searcher with `fzf`

How many times you created a shell alias for a command that is hard to remember, but then you also forgot the alias itself?

## Requirements

- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): You must have `fzf` installed.
- **Shell Compatibility**: Currently, this script is designed for `zsh`. However, contributions to extend its support to other shells are more than welcome!

## Installation

1. Ensure you have `fzf` installed. You can usually install it via your package manager, e.g., `brew install fzf` if you're on macOS.
2. Copy and paste the provided script into your `~/.zshrc` file.
3. The default key binding for invoking the alias searcher is `Ctrl-z`. If this clashes with another key binding, or if you'd simply prefer a different key, you're free to modify it to your liking within the script.
